Lib Gamefft 
===========================================

Author: Alioune Schurz

This program enables to identify the main structures with the given targeted molecular weight and seed scaffolds.
The core optimization problem solved within this procedure (referred as CSCCP) is solved in this distribution by implementing a Dynamic programming algorithm (DP):
A GPU accelerated version of the DP, named GAME, developed by Alioune Schurz is implemented in this library. 

NOTICE: official repository moved to https://github.com/CMDM-Lab/GAME.


Dependencies 
============

A. for basic Functionalities:
-----------------------------

numpy >= 1.7.1
openbabel-python >= 1.3
jinja2

B. for GPU support:
-------------------

cuda 5
pycuda
don't forget to configure the path and to mount the device in /dev (c.f. CUDA installation guide)

C. for cluster support:
-----------------------
make sure you install hadoop-1.0.3

Installation 
============

Please make sure that the libgamefft library is installed on your system. (Refer to the section A)

A installing the libgamefft
---------------------------

This will compile and install the library in /usr/lib/
From the distribution's root run:

cd lib/libgamefft
make
sudo make install


B installing the Python distribution
------------------------------------

It is very simple, just do:

1. Install libgamefft (cf. section A)
2. From the distribution's root run:  python setup.py install 
3. Test the distribution by running test.py 

Command line interface
======================

When installing the distribution, a script called csccp-solver-cli is installed. 

A Solving CSCCPs
----------------

Thanks to it you can solve CSCCP using different methods. Go at GAME/bin and type:

$> csccp-solver-cli -s GAME/examples/normal/example-data -m 168.195105 -v idp -l cc -r 3 -c 0 --dec 5

The program of csccp-solver-cli (GAME) will use the seed scaffolds included in the sepcified foldder after "-s" (the file in this case is s0000000001) 
to identified the structures having a targeted weight 168.195105 (-m 168.195105) in configuration 0 (-c 0) and ourput the top 3 (-r 3)  most probable
molecules.  The csccp-solver-cli used the DP algorithm (-v idp), implemented in C++ (-v cc).

PS. In general, r is set to 3~10, dec is set to 1~5
    In the file of *.cIdx, assume that the number in line 3 is x, we can set the index of configuration (-c) from 0 to x-1.

You should get this output in this case:

B Query information on scaffolds
--------------------------------

To query information on a scaffold file you can type:

$> csccp-solver-cli -s data/full_set/normal/s0000000001 -i

You should get this output:

Other informations
==================
The identified(validated) main structures in our four tesing natural products were provided in the GAME/examples/Datasets/structures

All seed scaffolds (*.cIdx files) in our collected database that can be used as input of the "csccp-solver-cli" program were provided in the GAME/examples/core_index
The index(filename) of seed scaffolds of the four datasets were listed in the GAME/examples/Datasets/scaffolds. (the parameter of -c in csccp-solver-cli)
The targeted molecular weights of the four datasets were also provided in GAME/examples/MW/. (the parameter of -m in csccp-solver-cli)
